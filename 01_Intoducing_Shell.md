# Lesson 01. Introducing the Shell

## Background
The *shell* is a command line interface program that allows you to control your computer with a keyboard rather than using your mouse and keyboard to control your computer through a graphical user interface (GUI). It may seem strange and difficult at first, but there are  many reasons master the shell.

* Most bioinformatics programs can only be run from the command line. So, you will have to become familiar with the shell if you want to work in genomics or transcriptomics.
* The shell gives the you power to do your work more efficiently and more quickly. This is the first step toward developing a reproducible research program.
* Cloud computers can only be accessed through command line interfaces.


## How to Access the Shell
The shell is already available on Mac and Linux machines. Windows users will have to download a separate program.

### Mac
On a Mac, the Unix Shell is available through the program **Terminal**. To open the Terminal, go to:

Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal 
Or
Type Terminal in the Spotlight Search

You may want to drag the Terminal application to your Dock for easy access.

### Windows
On Windows machines, you will need to download a program. There are many to choose from, bit Gitbash is very novice-friendly.

Download and install [Gitbash](http://msysgit.github.io);
Open up the program.


## Getting Starting with the Shell

Open either the Terminal (Mac) or Gitbash (Windows).

The dollar sign is a **prompt**, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input. 

~~~ {.bash}
$
~~~

When typing commands from these lessons, do not type the prompt($); only type the commands that follow it.
