# Lesson 01. Introducing the Shell

### Background
The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it’s a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so that they don’t have to type the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources including “high-performance computing (HPC)” supercomputers. These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.

### Installation
Mac users should open up the Terminal.
Windows should download Putty or GitBash

### Motivating Dataset
We will use a small dataset form the [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org) project to teach foundations of computing.
