The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it’s a powerful tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so that they don’t have to type the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources including “high-performance computing (HPC)” supercomputers. These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the utility and power of the Unix Shell
- Learn to view, create, and manipulate files and directories
- Learn to automate tasks to build reproducible research practices

## Topics Covered in this Lesson
01. Introducing the Shell
02. Navigating the Unix File System
03. Reading, Writing, Moving, Copying Files
04. Pipes, Filters, and Loops
05. Finding Things: Grep and History 
06. Bash Scripts

## Getting Ready **Download Practice Data** 
For this lesson, you will need to download some files in order to follow along.
1. Download and move [this file](./data/Shell_Transcriptomics.zip) to your **Desktop**
2. Unzip/extract the files. You should have a folder on your desktop called "Shell-Transcriptomics"

## Further Reading
- [Practical Computing for Biologists](http://practicalcomputing.org/) This is a highly recommended book for people looking for a systematic presentation on shell scripting, programming, UNIX, etc.
- A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects, Noble, PLoS Comp Biology, 2009.
