{"name":"Shell intro for transcriptomics","tagline":"Intro Shell Course Designed as a Precursor for Bioinformatics Courses","body":"# Introduction to the Unix Shell for Transcriptomics\r\nBy Rayna Harris\r\nInitialized February 15, 2015\r\nLast updated February 23, 2015\r\n\r\nThe Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it’s a powerful tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so that they don’t have to type the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources including “high-performance computing (HPC)” supercomputers. These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.\r\n\r\n## Learning Objectives\r\n- Understand the utility and power of the Unix Shell\r\n- Learn to view, create, and manipulate files and directories\r\n- Learn to automate tasks to build reproducible research practices\r\n\r\n## Topics Covered in this Lesson\r\n01. Introducing the Shell\r\n02. Navigating the Unix File System\r\n03. Reading, Writing, Moving, Copying Files\r\n04. Pipes, Filters, and Loops\r\n05. Finding Things: Grep and History \r\n06. Bash Scripts\r\n\r\n## Getting Ready: Download the Practice Data\r\nFor this lesson, you will need to download some files in order to follow along.\r\n\r\n1. **Download and move [this file](./data/Shell_Transcriptomics.zip) to your Desktop**\r\n2. If download does not start automatically, click \"View Raw\" to start the download.\r\n3. Unzip/extract the files. You should have a folder on your desktop called \"Shell-Transcriptomics\"\r\n\r\n## Further Reading\r\n- [Practical Computing for Biologists](http://practicalcomputing.org/) This is a highly recommended book for people looking for a systematic presentation on shell scripting, programming, UNIX, etc.\r\n- A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects, Noble, PLoS Comp Biology, 2009.\r\n\r\n## Useful Resources\r\nhttp://explainshell.com Not sure what a command means/does?
